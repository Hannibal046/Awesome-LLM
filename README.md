🔥 Large Language Models(LLM) have taken the ~~NLP community~~ ~~AI community~~ **the Whole World** by storm. Here is a curated list of papers about large language models, especially relating to ChatGPT. It also contains frameworks for LLM training, tools to deploy LLM, courses and tutorials about LLM and all publicly available LLM checkpoints and APIs.

## Trending LLM Projects

- [DeepSeek-v3](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3) - First open-sourced GPT-4o level model.
- [OpenAI o3 preview](https://openai.com/12-days/) - AGI, maybe?
- [Qwen2.5 Technical Report](https://huggingface.co/papers/2412.15115) - This report introduces Qwen2.5, a comprehensive series of large language models (LLMs) designed to meet diverse needs.
- [Genesis](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis) - A generative world for general-purpose robotics & embodied AI learning.
